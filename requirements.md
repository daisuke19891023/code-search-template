# Requirements

## Purpose: Why this template?
- Provide a shared baseline that enables **comparable experiments** to be run quickly.
- Offer a unified interface for invoking code-search tools (grep/keyword/semantic/AST/find) from both internal Actions and LLM tool calls.
- Support rapid iteration on algorithms and backends while capturing, visualizing, and optimizing results.
- Prevent research-phase pitfalls such as script proliferation, excessive glue code, and weak reproducibility, thereby smoothing the path from experiment to productionization.

## Outcomes and Value
- **Portability of experiments:** reusable, team-shareable setups without researcher-specific scripts.
- **Faster development:** once a tool is implemented it can be reused from both Action flows and LLM tool calls.
- **Transparent decision making:** structured metrics and flow traces enable confident improvement cycles.
- **Lower future extension costs:** new backends, AST languages, or metrics can be added with localized changes only.

## Non-goals
- Delivering a finished code-search or code-remediation product; the focus is on providing the **template foundation**.
- Addressing enterprise-specific CI/CD, access control, or large-scale distributed requirements (hooks and extension points are provided instead).

## Success Criteria (examples)
- Reproducible comparisons of Recall@K / nDCG on the same dataset presented in the UI.
- Backend swaps or parameter changes performed through configuration only, with automatic logging and visualization of results.
- Automatic generation of LLM tool schemas that significantly reduce the cost of integrating with agent runtimes.

## Intended Users & Scenarios
- **Researchers / ML Engineers:** perform A/B tests of search strategies, tune score fusions, and run Optuna-based exploration.
- **Product Engineers:** rapidly provision a stable set of tools suitable for LLM agent integration.
- **SRE / Platform Teams:** manage experimental results as data, sharing reproducible procedures and dependencies across teams.

### Representative Scenarios
1. Evaluate the sequence *semantic → grep* for conceptual queries vs. *grep → AST* for identifier lookups via a unified interface.
2. Swap the VectorStore from FAISS to an alternative implementation solely via configuration and compare performance.
3. Execute the same tools from an LLM agent’s tool calls and from offline batch experiments, while visualizing the execution flow in the UI.
4. Use Optuna to auto-tune score weights, thresholds, and TopK cutoffs, updating the baseline automatically.
